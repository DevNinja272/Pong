# Pong
This Pong game has been made from using Unity's game engine.   
The 'Build' and 'TemplateData' folders are the source folders when deploying the game onto a server (exported for WebGL).   
The build will not run locally (apparently from security reasons based on the forums), but it will run on FireFox and if it's run through a server.  
   
The 'Pong' folder is the project folder from Unity, so it includes all the sprites, sounds, scripts, and etc.
